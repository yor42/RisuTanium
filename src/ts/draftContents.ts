// instance that wrote it and can be offered back the next time the same
// identity is opened, even after an involuntary unmount.

// Registering the multi-tab-gate orphan key for a record (§6 of the plan) is
// layered on top of this store from the outside, by `draftContentOrphanGate.ts`.

// A frozen identity for the main message editor (chat window and
// `BookmarkList` both use it). `chatId` is `undefined` for a message that has

// group's first-message add, and trigger pushes all reach the DB this way).
